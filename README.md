# Mini Message Board

Mini message board is an app as part of an Odin Project assignment which utilizes ExpressJS to locally save messages created by a user and display them on the page. The purpose of the app was to create a basic interactive web app using Express. 

## Usage

To open, simply run `npm install` to download packages and open up the app by typing `npm start`. Once started, on `http://localhost:3000/` you will see the web application which allows you to see messages and create new messages. The messages are NOT stored on a database, they are simply stored locally using a variable so when you exit the app, messages will be lost.
